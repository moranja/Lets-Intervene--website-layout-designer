Let's Intervene helps you design the perfect layout for your website! Let's Intervene also anagrams to Event Listener, which felt especially apt considering the complicated web of event listeners holding our site together by the end. This was a module 3 final project for Flatiron made by Adam Moran, Theodore Kimana, and Trey Beauchamp.

The project encouraged us to focus on displaying a mastery of DOM manipulation and interacting with an API through a backend only, so for that reason there is little else on the backend, including user authentication. So when you come to the page for the first time, we're relying on the honor system for you to pick your username (or make a new one), then you can browse previously created layouts by all users, your previously created layouts, or create a new layout. 

The layout creator is a WYSIWYG editor that lets you add elements to the page and then drag, drop, and resize those elements. Once your element is where you want it, double click on it to lock it in, and to set additional details about that element!
